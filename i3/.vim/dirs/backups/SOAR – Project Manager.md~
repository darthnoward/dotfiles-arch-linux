**Role Description**

Overall in-charge of all projects and to oversee the big picture, the grand scheme of the club’s work progress. This is technically a bird’s eye view job, yet you must know each project’s plans inside out. Normally done via project leaders, a project manager must be on top of the situation at all time, and step in to settle any matters, in the absence of a project leader, or an in-charge person.

**Responsibilities**

1. Oversee *ALL* projects via Project Leaders 

This is the number 1 and utmost priority for the project manager. If all else fails, this must be maintained for the club to function. A project manager must always hold all their project leaders responsible for the datelines, deliverables and hold the project leader to its timeline and proposed outcomes. 

To that end, project leaders must be very carefully picked to ensure that every project is delivered to its stakeholders. Often times stakeholders can vary from internally (SOAR), to school departments (EPD), or even to external companies. This comes naturally hand-in-hand with a carefully scoped project, so that the SOAR team does not fail to deliver, and end up losing reputation, amongst trust and communications with stakeholders. This is ABSOLUTE KEY. 

2. Liaison between Stakeholder(s) and Project Teams

Most of the time, a project manager is very involved in dealing with external parties, and it is the Project Manager’s job to secure each project with their respective stakeholders, as well as to maintain good contact and relations with them. This includes providing regular updates, completing deliverables on time, administration and sometimes finance. If a project leader is deemed to be capable enough of handling further communications, then the project manager will only require to perform the bare minimum – delivering the project according to the plan.

3. EXCO and other Administrative Duties

As of now, the current main duties of the project manager are encompassed above. The Project Manager is also responsible for keeping the entire EXCO up to date on the project movements, and their progress. This also includes a regular review of project management processes and assuring healthy mental states for the members of SOAR. These are more administrative and HR-esque duties but are in the overall purview of the Project Manager. When projects do not deliver as intended, or problematic individuals arise, the Project leader and Project Manager must deal with the situation ASAP as well.

*IMPT NOTE: There is NO hard and fast rule to the etiquette of a project manager. This role is a constantly evolving role to fit the needs and growth of the club.*

**General Guidelines for Macro vs Micro Management**

There are 2 main ways to manage any project, of which are stated in the title. For all ideal cases and time consumption purposes, the general best way is to macro-manage any project. However, every project is to a certain extent, micro-managed and macro-managed. 

Macro-managing refers to the overall oversight of a project, to let the project be run by its Project Leader, and to frequently check on deliverables. This will no doubt include some nagging involved, and not much time investment other than core meetings with stakeholders.

Micro-managing, on the other hand is extremely time consuming, and refers to managing project deliverables on a personal basis, giving instructions to select individuals. There will be on some level be some micro-managing, but the Project Manager will ultimately want the Project Leader to run the show. This will come in particularly useful in dire situations where the Project Leader is unable to have full control over his or her members. The Project Manager must then intervene and take control of the project itself or address the individual issues. 

A healthy mix of both will be a weekly check on all projects, as well as monthly health checks on the members, plus some micro-management of Project Leaders to ensure proper project heading. 

Remember, the goal is to let the Project Leader run the show, and to push them in the direction of the club goals.

**Human Resource Management (Project Leader and Hierarchy)**

This section mainly talks about the roles involved in every project, and what is required of each role. The Project Manager is to update this section as deemed fit, and every project will have a few core roles, and other optional roles. This will be up to the Project Manager’s and Project Leader’s discretion. 

Depending on the scale of the project, you will want to disperse the roles within every project group. Naturally, this will have to suit the dynamics of the group. For most projects, if not all, an internal treasurer will be required, and to be advised by the Treasurer of the club, if necessary. Every project will be case by case basis, and to be reviewed by the project manager if the HR management is adequate, and if the leader needs to make changes.

Internal Human Resource Management also includes attending the poor performance within the group; which means that poor attendance or contribution will have to be dealt with effectively, and with proper guidance from the project manager, and the EXCO. A poor effort on the lacking group member will be first questioned (not interrogated) by the group leader and on an empathetic note. This means that the member will be given adequate chances to explain himself or herself, and not booted from the project (although this is the ultimatum). But we must do it in a civilised manner; the person himself or herself must come to terms that he or she is unable to commit proper effort for whatever reason. 

Hence if we push a member to leave the club/project for whatever reason, it is best of the club’s interests and the members interests that he or she leaves in peace and understanding.

**Project Planning and Introduction Phase**

For Project planning flow, refer to image provided in the folders.

For introduction phase and project member picking, there will be 3 waves of recruitment. *early*, *actual* and *post* recruitment. This is in time for new freshies every year and is to happen in concurrent with the end of the freshmore training phase. 

Early Phase:

People who are generally pre-matriculation or existing members of SOAR will be able to sign up during the early phase, where multiple teasers of new projects, and projects should be sourced by the project manager much earlier, prior to this, and present them during this phase. Enthusiastic or competent members can already begin projects, as project leaders.

Actual Recruitment Phase:

There will be a constant recruitment open up for 2-3weeks, to give members the time to decide their best choice to their 3rd best choice. The members will then be open up to the group leaders for pre-selection (on agreement between the project leader and the project member(s)), and then post selection by filling in the slots by preferred choice allocation. So this will occur over 2-3 weeks, followed by a 2 weeks of acclimatization for the members to ‘settle in’. Should the members decide that they made a mistake and wish to switch over to another project, they can, subject to project leaders and project manager approval.

Post Recruitment Phase:

This is where the members have settled in already, and most of the things are in order. Post recruitment is where new people, or additional people want to join out of circumstance, or simply because interests align. This is the tricky part, because integrating them into an on-going project may prove challenging, in terms of work allocation, etc. This is up to the project manager’s and leader’s discretion.

**Project Completion and Post Project AAR**

A project is complete on 3 conditions. Even if the project is a long term one, and decides to continue, there will be a interim in which the current project at hand is completed, and this will be a chance for new people to join/leave, etc. 

 

1. All Finances accounted for.

This means every person involved in the project has been paid, and there are no outstanding payments to be made to any person. Please take special care for large projects such as SAUVC.

2. AAR and Documentation Completed to be passed to the project manager for archiving

Documentation must be complete and wholesome for the project to be considered finished or passed on. AAR notes are for the sake of project manager and project leaders to come for review and improvements.

3. Stakeholders demands have been met and satisfied.

Some projects will involve external departments like pillars, or marketing, or even companies. So, these projects will only be complete upon delivery and satisfaction on their end. 

**Archiving and Documentation Matters**

Just keep everything neatly so we have a legacy of projects to look back on, to pick up again if wanted. Of **UTMOST** importance. Project Manager is to ensure proper archiving.
